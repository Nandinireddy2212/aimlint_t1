Task 1: Understanding Dataset & Data Types

This task involves understanding and analyzing the Titanic dataset using Python. The dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure, data types, and size. Categorical and numerical features were identified, and the target variable (Survived) was defined for machine learning. Missing values and class imbalance were analyzed to assess data quality. Based on this analysis, the dataset was found to be suitable for basic machine learning models after preprocessing.
