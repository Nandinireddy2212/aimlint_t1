Titanic Dataset

1. Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a commonly used dataset for supervised machine learning, especially for binary classification problems.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 418 rows and 12 columns, where each row represents a single passenger and each column represents a specific attribute such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and port of embarkation. The dataset size is moderate and provides sufficient information to perform exploratory data analysis and apply basic machine learning algorithms.

3. Feature Types

The dataset contains a mixture of different data types:

Numerical features: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch 

Categorical features: Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked

Ordinal feature: Pclass (Passenger Class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Binary feature: Survived

This diversity of features makes the dataset suitable for learning how to handle numerical and categorical data during preprocessing.

4. Target Variable and Input Features

The target variable in the Titanic dataset is Survived, which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). All remaining columns act as input features used to predict the survival outcome. This clearly defines the problem as a binary classification task, making the dataset appropriate for machine learning.

5. Data Quality Analysis

Several data quality issues are observed in the dataset. The Age column contains missing values, which may require imputation using statistical methods such as mean or median. The Cabin column has a large number of missing values and may need to be dropped or simplified. The Embarked column contains a small number of missing entries that can be handled using the most frequent category. Additionally, the target variable Survived shows class imbalance, with more passengers not surviving than surviving, which may affect model performance if not addressed.

6. Dataset Size and Machine Learning Suitability

With 418 records, the dataset is suitable for applying basic machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Although it is not a large-scale dataset, it is sufficient for training, testing, and evaluating models.

7. Conclusion

In conclusion, the Titanic dataset is well-structured and appropriate for machine learning applications. Although, it contains missing values and class imbalance that require preprocessing. After proper preprocessing, the dataset can be effectively used to build and evaluate classification models.
